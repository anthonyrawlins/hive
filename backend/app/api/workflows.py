    Create a new multi-agent workflow for task orchestration and automation.
    
    This endpoint allows you to define complex workflows that coordinate multiple
    agents to perform sophisticated development and operational tasks.
    
    **Workflow Creation Process:**
    1. **Validation**: Validate workflow structure and step definitions
    2. **Agent Verification**: Verify required agent specializations are available
    3. **Dependency Analysis**: Analyze step dependencies and execution order
    4. **Resource Planning**: Estimate resource requirements and execution time
    5. **Storage**: Persist workflow definition for future execution
    
    **Workflow Step Types:**
    - `code_analysis`: Static code analysis and review
    - `testing`: Test execution and validation
    - `build`: Compilation and build processes
    - `deployment`: Application deployment and configuration
    - `documentation`: Documentation generation and updates
    - `security_scan`: Security analysis and vulnerability assessment
    - `performance_test`: Performance testing and benchmarking
    - `data_processing`: Data transformation and analysis
    
    **Advanced Features:**
    - **Conditional Execution**: Steps can have conditions and branching logic
    - **Parallel Execution**: Steps can run in parallel for improved performance
    - **Error Handling**: Define retry policies and error recovery procedures
    - **Variable Substitution**: Use variables and templates for flexible workflows
    - **Agent Selection**: Specify agent requirements and selection criteria
    - **Timeout Management**: Configure timeouts for individual steps and overall workflow
    
    **Best Practices:**
    - Keep steps focused and atomic for better reliability
    - Use meaningful names and descriptions for clarity
    - Include appropriate error handling and retry logic
    - Optimize step ordering for performance and dependencies
    - Test workflows thoroughly before production use
